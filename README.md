## 🪙 token formats

all formats supported in `tokens.txt`:

```
TOKEN
email@example.com:password:TOKEN
email@example.com:TOKEN
```

emails are automatically masked in logs for privacy.

---

## 🌐 proxy format

```
host:port
user:pass@host:port
```

one proxy per line in `proxies.txt`. if the file is missing or empty, requests go direct.

---

## 🚀 usage

```bash
python checker.py
```

you'll be asked for one thing at startup:

| prompt | description |
|--------|-------------|
| `Threads` | how many tokens to check at the same time |

higher threads = faster but more likely to hit rate limits. `50–100` is a safe range.

---

## 📊 what gets checked

### 💳 payment sources
checks each payment method on the account and reports:

```
brand       →  Visa, Mastercard, Amex, etc.
last 4      →  last 4 digits of the card
validity    →  whether discord considers it valid
expiry      →  expiry month / year if available
age         →  how long the card has been on the account
```

### 💎 nitro status

| status | meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `Active` | currently has nitro — shows type (Classic / Nitro / Basic) |
| `Expired recently` | had nitro, ended within ~18 months |
| `Had Nitro (old)` | had nitro but ended a long time ago |
| `Never had Nitro` | never subscribed |

---

## 🖥️ live console output

the header updates in real time showing:

```
[Checked: 142 ] [Valid: 23 ] [Invalid: 89 ] [💎 Active: 4 ] [Had: 11 ] [Never: 18 ]
```

each result is logged with a timestamp and color-coded badge:

```
[12:34:56] [✓ VALID  ] Visa ****4242 (2y 3mo old) Exp: 12/2027 | ab***@gmail.com | tok123...
[12:34:56] [💎 NITRO ] Active subscription | Nitro | ab***@gmail.com | tok123...
[12:34:56] [✗ ERROR  ] Invalid token | tok456...
[12:34:56] [⚠ WARN   ] No payment on file | tok789...
```

---

## ⚠️ notes

- up to `3` retries per token before marking as error
- proxies are picked randomly per request — not round-robin
- all output files are appended, not overwritten — safe to run multiple times
- `output/` folder is created automatically if it doesn't exist
